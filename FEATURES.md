## 📊 AI Matching Process

### Step 1: Profile Analysis
```python
student_skills = ["Python", "React", "MongoDB"]
student_locations = ["Bangalore", "Delhi"]
student_domains = ["Technology", "Fintech"]
```

### Step 2: Requirement Matching
```python
internship_required = ["Python", "React"]
internship_preferred = ["Docker", "AWS"]
internship_location = "Bangalore"
```

### Step 3: Score Calculation
```python
skills_match = matching_required / total_required
preferred_match = matching_preferred / total_preferred
location_match = 1.0 if match else 0.5

final_score = (skills_match * 50) + 
              (preferred_match * 20) + 
              (location_match * 30)
```

### Step 4: Ranking & Recommendations
- Sort by match score (descending)
- Filter threshold: >40% match
- Return top N recommendations
